HAZUS-MH is a free risk assessment software tool provided by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. HAZUS-MH contains a comprehensive earthquake loss estimation modeling system.

The Python API for HAZUS-MH Earthquake will allow programmatic access to create HAZUS study regions, import building inventory and hazard maps, run analyses, and export results.

Another project goal is to support configurable "remote control" analyses triggered by the availability of near-real-time ShakeMaps provided by the USGS, and distributed across multiple HAZUS-MH systems.
